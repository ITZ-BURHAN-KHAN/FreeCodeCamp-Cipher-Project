# FreeCodeCamp-Cipher-Project
This project implements a simple encryption and decryption cipher in Python, as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. It demonstrates string manipulation techniques and foundational programming skills, allowing users to easily encode and decode messages. The code is modular and beginner-friendly, making it a great exercise in understanding ciphers.
